# Family Feud Game

I recreated the Family Feud game for fun. It contains a screen that displays the board in Family Feud as well as a connection to an app that the host can use to control the screen. 

Run [run_family_feud](Run data/run_family_feud) to run the code. You must have MIT App Inventor for the game to work.
